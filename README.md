# Minecraft-Tools
Some tools I use to make it easier to manage minecraft servers and install mods.
This is all in a really early state and most of it isn't finish.
## Using the ClientInstaller/ModInstaller
The executeable takes a arg of the file that it will install the mods from.
### Quick Start
Make sure you have the dotnet runtime
`<DLLName>.dll mod.package.json`

## Using the ServerManager
Right now it's in a super basic form so all you have to do is execute the dll with a arg of the server setup
